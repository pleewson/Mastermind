# Mastermind
***Mastermind*** is a logic game where the player tries to guess a hidden color code within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the player receives feedback with black and white markers to help them get closer to the solution.

# How to start:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pleewson/Mastermind.git
cd Mastermind
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or run it manually using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

Then, open your browser and navigate to:
```bash
localhost:8080
```

Enjoy the challenge.
